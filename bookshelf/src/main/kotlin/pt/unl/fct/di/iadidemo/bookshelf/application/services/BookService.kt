/**
 * This is a sample class implementing the application logic layer, the service layer.
 *
 * Each service should implement logic that is closely related. It can use
 * other services to orchestrate its functionality.
 *
 * This service declares a dependency for the repository service in the data
 * layer that manipulates the information about books. Notice that the class
 * is annotated with @Service so that Spring can instantiate the corresponding
 * Bean and connect to other components.
 *
 * This implements two sample methods that use and orchestrate methods from the
 * database repository. It can also perform intermediate computations to prepare
 * data.
